      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a catalog of all known possible sources of RFI using various databases, available here.. This spreadsheet has an entry for every recorded wireless transmission source from:
 Met. Sat. database OSCAR SigID Wiki JE9PEL  As well as Wikipedia in general and Green Bank&amp;rsquo;s own database. The current list only covers L-band, though I want to include more tabs for other bands as well.
 A collection of satellite transmissions and information about them.</description>

      <description>I am a leaderboard moderator and speedrunner of Titanfall 2! Speedrunning is a hobby centered around completing a video game as fast as possible, using glitches, skips, and exploits. Each game is incredibly unique in the ways it can be broken apart and progressed through. Titanfall is a little bit of an exception, as there are not very many glitches used throughout the 1.5 hour run. We only go out-of-bounds twice, and only skip two scripted fight sequences.</description>
