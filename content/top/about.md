I'm a Ph.D candidate at West Virginia University primarily focused on Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) Mitigation techniques. Any wireless transmissions (satellite, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radar, the list goes on...) can be detected by the incredibly sensitive radio telescopes scattered around the world, and often prevents them from exploring interesting science. RFI Mitigation helps these telescopes recover sound scientific data and keep making incredible discoveries. Check out the RFI-Mitigation tab to read more about what I've been developing and learning about!



I am also an avid mountain biker and hiker, and tend to find myself lost in the woods semi-frequently. I am always on the lookout for new wild places to explore. I dabble in pick-up hockey as well, though I'm not very good.


I'm heavily involved in Titanfall 2 speedrunning - which, in general, is the craft of finishing a video game as fast as possible via glitches, practice, exploits, and persistence. I am a moderator of the leaderboard, which involves checking user submissions for cheating and verifying their runs. Recently, I've been mostly focused on finding a skip for one of the most boring levels in the game - Abyss 2. This can be done in a myriad of possible ways, which could involve reverse-engineering the Assembly code that generates save files, routing an out-of-bounds path to the end of the level, or manipulating the game's memory of previous checkpoints. More info can be found in the Side-Projects tab!
